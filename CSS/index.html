                  <br><br>
                  <u>Padding:</u> padding refers to the space between an element and the content inside it.Padding will be used if we want to create space between an element and the edge of the container, or the border.This would also show the containerâ€™s background around the element inside it.
                  <br>
                  Padding is also used to change the size of an element. When we increase the padding value, the text will stay the same size, but there will be more space around it. The element will also fill more space inside the container.
